CareConnect Hub is a web application that aims to connect people within a community and provide them with resources and support. The app features various sections such as neighborhood events, your apartment, fixing something broken, health help, local groups, fitness for you, community courses, and gaming friends.

This project is a working visual prototype developed for IHME competition, organized by Metropolia's innovation hubs and co-development platforms.
